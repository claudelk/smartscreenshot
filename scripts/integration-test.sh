# CaptureFlow — Automated Integration Tests
#==============================================================
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - CaptureFlow.app must be running (pipeline enabled)
#   - The app must have Accessibility permission granted
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/integration-test.sh
#
# This script uses `screencapture` to create screenshots and
# verifies the app detects and renames them correctly.
