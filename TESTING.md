# CaptureFlow — Testing Checklist

---

## Part A: Automated Tests (run by script)

Run: `./scripts/integration-test.sh`

The script creates synthetic PNG files in the screenshot folder and verifies the app
detects and renames them. It toggles settings via `defaults write` and restarts
the app to test different configurations.

| # | Test | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1.2 | Screenshot is renamed into `screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD/` folder | PASS |
| 1.4 | Renamed file has content-based name (not "Screenshot ...") | PASS |
| 1.5 | File extension is `.png` | PASS |
| 1.2b | Folder name starts with `screenshot_` (groupByApp off) | PASS |
| 2.3 | While disabled, screenshot is NOT renamed | PASS |
| 2.4 | After re-enabling, screenshots are renamed again | PASS |
| 4.1 | `groupByApp` is off by default | PASS |
| 4.2 | With groupByApp off, folder is `screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD/` | PASS |
| 4.3 | groupByApp setting can be toggled on | PASS |
| 4.5 | After disabling groupByApp, back to `screenshot_` folder | PASS |
| 8.3 | Batch rename 5 files via CLI `sst --rename` | PASS |
| 9.1 | 3 rapid screenshots → all 3 renamed | PASS |
| 9.2 | All renamed files have unique names | PASS |
| 9.3 | All land in the same date folder | PASS |

## Part B: Manual Tests (you must do these)

These require GUI interaction (clicking menus, opening dialogs, visual checks)
that cannot be automated. Mark each as PASS or FAIL. Add notes for any failures.

### Menu Bar — Visual

- [ ] **1.1** Launch app → camera icon appears in menu bar
- [ ] **2.1** Click menu → "Disable" shown when pipeline is running
- [ ] **2.2** Click "Disable" → menu now shows "Enable"
- [ ] **2.5** "Re-analyze Last Screenshot" is grayed out before first rename
- [ ] **2.6** After a rename, "Re-analyze Last Screenshot" is clickable
- [ ] **2.7** Click "Re-analyze Last Screenshot" → file is re-renamed
- [ ] **2.10** "Open Screenshot Folder" → opens folder in Finder
- [ ] **2.11** "Quit CaptureFlow" → app exits, icon disappears

### Menu Bar — Batch Rename Dialog

- [ ] **2.8** "Batch Rename Screenshots..." → file picker opens, can select multiple PNGs
- [ ] **2.9** Selected files are renamed and moved into `screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD/`
- [ ] **8.1** Cancel file picker without selecting → nothing happens
- [ ] **8.2** Select 1 file → it is renamed
- [ ] **8.4** Batch rename an already-renamed file → re-renamed (no crash)

### Preferences — Screenshot Folder

- [ ] **3.6** Take a screenshot → lands in the DEFAULT folder

### Preferences — Group by App

- [ ] **4.1v** Checkbox "Group screenshots by frontmost app" visible and unchecked by default
- [ ] **4.3v** Check the checkbox → no crash, setting persists
- [ ] **4.4** With groupByApp ON, take a real screenshot (Cmd+Shift+3) with an app in front → folder uses app name (e.g. `safari_YYYY-MM-DD/`)

### Preferences — Naming Mode

- [ ] **5.1** Dropdown shows "Standard" selected
- [ ] **5.2** "Enhanced" and "Advanced" are visible but disabled (Coming Soon)

- [ ] **7.4** Disable → Ctrl+Option+S does nothing

### Real Screenshots

- [ ] **1.3** Take screenshot with Cmd+Shift+4 (area select) → renamed correctly

### App Lifecycle

- [ ] **10.1** Quit and relaunch → settings preserved (folder, groupByApp, etc.)
